# The ACRU-HYDAT Streamflow Verification Tool

The ACRU-HYDAT Streamflow Verification Tool was developed to automate the process of verifying output data for the ACRU (v336) model against HYDAT data from Environment Canada. The calibration and validation process of modelling are key in hydrological modelling studies. This tool is used in the verification process of streamflow data:

 - compare observed and simulated streamflow data (mm/day)
 - summarize the results of the comparative statistical analysis for conservation statistics, regression statistics, error index statistics, and dimensionless statistics
 - create daily and monthly scatter plot graphs
 - create daily and monthly daily flow duration curves
 - create a monthly and annual seasonal flow graphs
 - create a sequence of annual hydrographs for the available time period.
